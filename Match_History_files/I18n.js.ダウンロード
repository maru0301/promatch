During this transition, we\u2019re currently storing each match of League of Legends in two locations: one in the \u201cold\u201d data storage, and one in the \u201cnew\u201d data storage.<\/p><p>The old match history (the one with just 10 matches and limited data) is built off of the old data storage. This is also what the Riot API builds off of for 3rd party sites.<\/p><p>The new match history is built off of a new storage, and while we\u2019re very confident that you\u2019ll have an awesome experience, there still is a potential for bugs. These bugs can cause things like data corruption, loss of data, incorrect data, or other problems. We\u2019ve tested the new match history a whole bunch internally, but we can\u2019t 100% guarantee that there won\u2019t be bugs.<\/p><p>So to answer the question: \u201cbeta\u201d means that we might have bugs, and in the worst cases, we could lose matches or other data. \u201cBeta\u201d also means that we\u2019ll be tweaking what data is available on the page, and adding new graphs and visualizations as we go. This is an evolving experience, not the final experience.<\/p>","faq_question_3":"What graphs are available?","faq_answer_3":"We currently have 5 graphs available:<ul><li>Gold Advantage - the difference in cumulative gold between the two teams over the course of the match<\/li><li>Team Gold - the cumulative gold value for each team over the course of the match<\/li><li>Individual Gold - the cumulative gold for each individual champion over the course of the match<\/li><li>Champion Kills - the kill locations for each hero in the match<\/li><li>Building Destroyed - the final building states at the end of the match<\/li><\/ul>","faq_question_4":"How many matches can I see (I know it\u2019s more than 10, but come on, rito pls)?","faq_answer_4":"You should be able to see nearly all matches since May 1st. TeamBuilder matches and matches for recently transferred summoners may not have been collected prior to patch 4.8.","faq_question_5":"How long will my matches be saved?","faq_answer_5":"We have no plans to delete data, though we likely can\u2019t hold onto every match indefinitely. Our current thoughts are that we\u2019ll hold onto a match for a full year. This could change in the future.","faq_question_6":"So ranked matches are public, what about normal matches?","faq_answer_6":"We strive for normal queues to balance fun and winning. League is a competitive match, but players enter normal queues to have a good match with friends or try out new champions and playstyles without the pressure of ranked. While you\u2019ll be able to see the end-of-match info from normal matches even if you aren\u2019t friends with those players, summoner information will be hidden. For example, if you aren\u2019t friends with a player that appears in your normal queue match history, you\u2019ll see the name of the champion they were playing, rather than their summoner name.","faq_question_7":"What if I see a champion name or summoner name in a match?","faq_answer_7":"The default assumption is that we show a champion name. The summoner name is visible instead if any of the following conditions are met:<ul><li>It\u2019s a ranked match<\/li><li>You are the summoner<\/li><li>You are friends with the summoner<\/li><li>The summoner shared their match with you. In technical terms, this means that the summoner\u2019s numerical identifier was appended onto the URL.<\/li><\/ul>","faq_question_8":"What determines visible matches in another summoner\u2019s match history list?","faq_answer_8":"<ul><li>All ranked matches for the current season are visible<\/li><li>Normal matches will be visible if you are friends with the summoner<\/li><li>Custom matches are only visible to yourself<\/li><\/ul>","faq_question_9":"How do I report bugs?","faq_answer_9":"Use our bug report forum","faq_question_10":"How do I give feedback or make suggestions?","faq_answer_10":"Use our feedback\/suggestion forum","kdabadge_perfect":"Perfect","date_format":"{{ month }}\/{{ day }}\/{{ year }}","gold_format":"{{ gold }}k","thousand_format":"{{ number }}k","million_format":"{{ number }}M","xp_format":"XP","ip_format":"IP","map_summoners_rift":"Summoner's Rift","map_howling_abyss":"Howling Abyss","map_butchers_bridge":"Butcher's Bridge","map_crystal_scar":"The Crystal Scar","map_twisted_treeline":"Twisted Treeline","mode_custom":"Custom","mode_classic":"Classic","mode_dominion":"Dominion","mode_aram":"ARAM","mode_ascension":"Ascension","mode_one_for_all":"One for All","mode_first_blood":"First Blood","mode_urf":"U.R.F.","mode_one_for_all_mirror":"One for All: Mirror Mode","mode_team_builder":"Team Builder","mode_doom_bots_of_doom":"Doom Bots of Doom","queue_custom":"Custom","queue_coop_vs_ai":"Coop vs AI","queue_normal_blind_pick":"Normal (Blind Pick)","queue_normal_draft_mode":"Normal (Draft Mode)","queue_normal_team_builder":"Normal (Team Builder)","queue_ranked_draft_mode":"Ranked (Draft Mode)","queue_ranked_team":"Ranked Team","queue_aram":"Normal (All Random)","queue_one_for_all":"One for All","queue_one_for_all_mirror":"One for All: Mirror Mode","queue_first_blood":"First Blood","queue_urf_mode":"U.R.F.
